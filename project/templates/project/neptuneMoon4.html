            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Potato-shaped Naiad is most likely made up of fragments of Neptune's original satellites, which were
                smashed up by disturbances when the ice giant captured its largest moon, Triton. It is probable that
                Naiad has not been modified by any internal geological processes since its formation.</p>
            <p>Naiad orbits close to Neptune. The small moon circles the planet every seven hours and six minutes in a
                decaying orbit; Naiad may eventually crash into Neptune's atmosphere or be torn apart and form a
                planetary ring.</p>


            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>Naiad was the last moon to be discovered during the Voyager 2 flyby in September 1989.</p>

            <h2>How Naiad Got its Name</h2>
            <p>Naiad is named after a type of nymph who presided over fountains, wells, springs, streams, and brooks in
                Greek mythology. Naiad was originally designated S/1989 N 6.</p>
