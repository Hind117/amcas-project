            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar system and the only moon with its own magnetic field. The
                magnetic field causes auroras, which are ribbons of glowing, electrified gas, in regions circling the
                moon’s north and south poles. Ganymede has large, bright regions of ridges and grooves that slice across
                older, darker terrains. These grooved regions are a clue that the moon experienced dramatic upheavals in
                the distant past. Scientists have also found strong evidence of an underground ocean on Ganymede.
            </p>
            <p>Ganymede is named for a boy who was made cupbearer for the ancient Greek gods by Zeus – Jupiter to the
                Romans
            </p>
            <p>Ganymede has three main layers. A sphere of metallic iron at the center (the core, which generates a
                magnetic field), a spherical shell of rock (mantle) surrounding the core, and a spherical shell of
                mostly ice surrounding the rock shell and the core. The ice shell on the outside is very thick, maybe
                800 km (497 miles) thick. The surface is the very top of the ice shell. Though it is mostly ice, the ice
                shell might contain some rock mixed in. Scientists believe there must be a fair amount of rock in the
                ice near the surface. Ganymede's magnetic field is embedded inside Jupiter's massive magnetosphere.
            </p>
            <p>Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope found evidence of thin oxygen atmosphere on Ganymede in
                1996. The atmosphere is far too thin to support life as we know it.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2004, scientists discovered irregular lumps beneath the icy surface of Ganymede. The irregular masses
            may be rock formations, supported by Ganymede's icy shell for billions of years. This tells scientists
            that the ice is probably strong enough, at least near the surface, to support these possible rock masses
            from sinking to the bottom of the ice. However, this anomaly could also be caused by piles of rock at
            the bottom of the ice.
            </p>
            <p>Spacecraft images of Ganymede show the moon has a complex geological history. Ganymede's surface is a
                mixture of two types of terrain. Forty percent of the surface of Ganymede is covered by highly cratered
                dark regions, and the remaining sixty percent is covered by a light grooved terrain, which forms
                intricate patterns across Ganymede. The term "sulcus," meaning a groove or burrow, is often used to
                describe the grooved features. This grooved terrain is probably formed by tensional faulting or the
                release of water from beneath the surface. Groove ridges as high as 700 m (2,000 feet) have been
                observed and the grooves run for thousands of kilometers across Ganymede's surface. The grooves have
                relatively few craters and probably developed at the expense of the darker crust. The dark regions on
                Ganymede are old and rough, and the dark cratered terrain is believed to be the original crust of the
                satellite. Lighter regions are young and smooth (unlike Earth's Moon). The largest area on Ganymede is
                called Galileo Regio.
            </p>
            <p>The large craters on Ganymede have almost no vertical relief and are quite flat. They lack central
                depressions common to craters often seen on the rocky surface of the Moon. This is probably due to slow
                and gradual adjustment to the soft icy surface. These large phantom craters are called palimpsests, a
                term originally applied to reused ancient writing materials on which older writing was still visible
                underneath newer writing. Palimpsests range from 50 to 400 km in diameter. Both bright and dark rays of
                ejecta exist around Ganymede's craters -- rays tend to be bright from craters in the grooved terrain and
                dark from the dark cratered terrain.
            </p>
            <h2>Discovery
            </h2>
            <p>Ganymede was discovered by Galileo Galilei on Jan. 7, 1610. The discovery, along with three other Jovian
                moons, was the first time a moon was discovered orbiting a planet other than Earth. The discovery of the
                four Galilean satellites eventually led to the understanding that planets in our solar system orbit the
                sun, instead of our solar system revolving around Earth.
            </p>
            <p>Simon Marius probably made an independent discovery of the moons at about the same time that Galileo did,
                and he may have unwittingly sighted them up to a month earlier, but the priority must go to Galileo
                because he published his discovery first.
            </p>

            <h2>How Ganymede Got its Name
            </h2>
            <p>Galileo originally called Jupiter's moons the Medicean planets, after the Medici family and referred to
                the individual moons numerically as I, II, III, and IV. Galileo's naming system would be used for a
                couple of centuries.
            </p>
            <p>It wouldn't be until the mid-1800's that the names of the Galilean moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and
                Callisto, would be officially adopted, and only after it became apparent that naming moons by number
                would be very confusing as new additional moons were being discovered.
            </p>
            <p>In mythology, Ganymede ("GAN uh meed") was a beautiful young boy who was carried to Olympus by Zeus (the
                Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter) disguised as an eagle. Ganymede became the cupbearer of the
                Olympian gods
