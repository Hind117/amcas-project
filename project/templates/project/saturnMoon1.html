            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Iapetus has been called the yin and yang of the Saturn moons because its leading hemisphere has a
                reflectivity (or albedo) as dark as coal (albedo 0.03-0.05 with a slight reddish tinge) and its trailing
                hemisphere is much brighter at 0.5-0.6.</p>
            <p>Saturn's third largest moon, Iapetus has a mean radius of 457 miles (736 kilometers) and a density only
                1.2 times that of liquid water. It has been suggested that Iapetus (like Rhea) is three quarters ice and
                one quarter rock.
            </p>
            <p>Iapetus orbits at 2,213,000 miles (3,561,000 kilometers) from Saturn. The great distance from Saturn's
                tidal forces and from most of the other moons and ring particles has probably allowed the Iapetus
                surface to be largely unaffected by any melting episodes that could have caused some smoothing or
                "resurfacing" as on some of the moons closer to Saturn.
            </p>
            <p>However, despite the great distance, Saturn has tidally locked Iapetus. The moon always presents the same
                face toward Saturn. With its distant, inclined orbit, Iapetus is the only large moon from which there is
                a nice view of the rings of Saturn.</p>
            <p>As with some other Saturnian moons, Iapetus is in resonance with Saturn's largest moon, Titan, which
                orbits at 759,200 miles (1,221,850 kilometers). That means that the two objects speed up and slow down
                as they pass each other in a complex set of variations. However, Iapetus has a diameter less than a
                third of Titan's diameter, so Titan's rotation and orbit are affected much less than those of
                Iapetus.</p>
            <p>Giovanni Cassini observed the dark-light difference of this moon's surface when he discovered Iapetus in
                1671. He noted that he could only see Iapetus on the west side of Saturn. He correctly concluded that
                Iapetus had one side much darker than the other side, and that Iapetus was tidally locked with
                Saturn.</p>
            <p>Scientists have long wondered why one hemisphere of Iapetus is so dark in comparison to its other
                hemisphere, and in comparison to other surfaces in the Saturn system. Iapetus may be sweeping up
                particles from the more-distant dark moon, Phoebe. If that is the darkening mechanism, it should be
                steadily renewing the dark surface because very few fresh bright craters are detected within the dark
                terrain. An alternate theory is that there might be ice volcanism distributing darker material to the
                surface. Volcano-like eruptions of hydrocarbons might form the dark surfaces, particularly after
                chemical reactions caused by solar radiation.
            </p>
            <p>The September 2007 Cassini flyby of Iapetus showed that a third process, thermal segregation, is probably
                the most responsible for Iapetus' dark hemisphere. Iapetus has a very slow rotation, longer than 79
                days. Such a slow rotation means that the daily temperature cycle is very long, so long that the dark
                material can absorb heat from the sun and warm up. (The dark material absorbs more heat than the bright
                icy material.) This heating will cause any volatile, or icy, species within the dark material to sublime
                out, and retreat to colder regions on Iapetus. This sublimation of volatiles causes the dark material to
                become even darker -- and causes neighboring bright, cold regions to become even brighter. Iapetus may
                have experienced a (possibly small) influx of dark material from an external source, which could have
                warmed up and triggered this thermal segregation process.</p>
            <p>The second most notable feature of Iapetus is its "equatorial ridge," a chain of 6-mile (10-km) high
                mountains girdling the moon's equator. On the anti-Saturnian side of Iapetus, the ridge appears to break
                up and distinct, partially bright mountains are observed. The Voyager I and Voyager II encounters
                provided the first knowledge of these mountains, and they are informally referred to as the Voyager
                Mountains.

                There are two theories on how the ridge formed. Some scientists think the ridge was formed at an earlier
                time when Iapetus rotated much faster than it does today; others think the ridge is made of material
                left from the collapse of a ring.</p>
            <h2>Discovery
            </h2>
            <p>Giovanni Cassini discovered Iapetus on Oct. 25, 1671. However, to astronomers Iapetus appeared only as a
                dot whose brightness varied from brighter to fainter over the course of an orbit around Saturn. The
                Voyager I and Voyager II encounters in 1980 and 1981 validated Cassini's original observations and
                explanation with images showing the different reflectivity of Iapetus' hemispheres.

            <h2>How Iapetus Got its Name
            </h2>
            <p>John Herschel suggested that the moons of Saturn be associated with the mythical brothers and sisters of
                Kronus. (Kronus is the equivalent of the Roman god Saturn in Greek mythology.)</p>
            <p>The name Iapetus comes from the Greek god (or Titan) Iapetus, who is a son of Uranus and Gaia, a brother
                to Kronus and the father of Atlas and Prometheus. As the father of Prometheus, the ancient Greeks
                regarded Iapetus as the father of the human race.
            </p>
            <p>Cassini referred to Iapetus as one of the four Sidera Lodoicea (Stars of Louis) after King Louis XIV (the
                other three were Tethys, Dione and Rhea). Other astronomers called Iapetus by its number in the order of
                moons discovered at the time. Iapetus started as Saturn V, and it became Saturn VIII after additional
                moons were discovered. Geological features on Iapetus generally get their names from the French epic
                poem "The Song of Roland." </p>
