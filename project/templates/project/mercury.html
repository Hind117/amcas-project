            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <img src="{% static 'project/images/mercury.png' %}" alt="">
            <br/>
            <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun,
                <br/>Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury,
                <br/>the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth,
                <br/>and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun,
                <br/>Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus,
                <br/>thanks to its dense atmosphere.
                <br/>But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.
                <br/>Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers),
                Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth.
                If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.
                <br/>From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical
                units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to
                Earth.
                From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles
                (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun.
                It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles
                (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet.
                <br/> Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury
                is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun
                (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by a sunrise and sunset like it is on
                most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly,
                set and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset
                for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth
                days—just over two years on Mercury.
                <br/>Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around
                the Sun. That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience seasons like many other
                planets do.
            </p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from
                collisions with meteoroids and comets. Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased
                artists, musicians or authors, including children's author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.
                <br/>Very large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and
                Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by asteroid impacts on the
                planet's surface early in the solar system's history. While there are large areas of smooth terrain,
                there are also cliffs, some hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high. They rose as the
                planet's interior cooled and contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.
                <br/>Most of Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright streaks are
                called "crater rays." They are formed when an asteroid or comet strikes the surface. The tremendous
                amount of energy that is released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a
                huge amount of rock under the point of impact. Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the
                crater and then falls to the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed rock are more
                reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter. The space environment—dust impacts and
                solar-wind particles—causes the rays to darken with time.
                <br/>Temperatures on the surface of Mercury are extreme, both hot and cold. During the day, temperatures
                on Mercury's surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius). Because the planet has no
                atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees
                Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius).
                <br/>Mercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in regions of
                permanent shadow. There it could be cold enough to preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on
                sunlit parts of the planet.
            </p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by
                the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium,
                hydrogen, helium and potassium.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. Though Mercury's magnetic field at
                the surface has just one percent the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the
                solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma
                down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged
                atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Mercury has no moon.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that
                characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.</p>
