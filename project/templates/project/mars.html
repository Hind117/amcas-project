            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <img src="{% static 'project/images/mars.png' %}" alt="">
            <br/>
            <p>Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of
                blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute; for example, the Egyptians called
                it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because
                iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.
            </p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the
                size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.
            </p>
            <p>From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units
                away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.
                From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.
            </p>

            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on
                Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols—short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols,
                which is the same as 687 Earth days.
            </p>
            <p>Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This
                is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct
                seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun
                (because it's farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year,
                lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars'
                elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.
            </p>
            <p>Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in
                the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern winter/southern
                summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern winter is 178 sols.
            </p>

            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors such as brown, gold, and tan. The
                reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidization—or rusting—of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian
                “soil”), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the
                planet appear mostly red.
            </p>
            <p>Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same area as
                Earth’s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as
                dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most
                interesting topographical features.
            </p>
            <p>A large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California to New York—more
                than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and
                4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That's about 10 times the size of Earth's Grand Canyon.
            </p>
            <p>Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. It's three times taller than
                Earth's Mt. Everest with a base the size of the state of New Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>Mars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well
                as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features suggest
                that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago.
            </p>
            <p>There is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long
                on the surface. Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the
                polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater
                walls.
            </p>

            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the
                sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth.
                Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites,
                asteroids, and comets.
            </p>
            <p>The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about
                -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun
                easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would
                feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32
                degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).
            </p>
            <p>Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After
                such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles.
            </p>


            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are
                highly magnetized, indicating traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago.​
            </p>


            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They're potato-shaped
                because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical.
            </p>
            <p>The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.
            </p>
            <p>Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep grooves on its surface. It is
                slowly moving towards Mars and will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.
            </p>
            <p>Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther away from Mars.
                Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it
                appear smoother than pockmarked Phobos.
            </p>


            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>
                Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for
                signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.
