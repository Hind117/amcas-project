            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Oberon is the second largest moon of Uranus. Discovered in 1787, little was known about this moon until
                Voyager 2 passed it during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Oberon is heavily cratered―similar to
                Umbriel―especially when compared to three other moons of Uranus: Ariel, Titania and Miranda. Like all of
                Uranus' large moons, Oberon is composed of roughly half ice and half rock. Oberon has at least one large
                mountain that rises about 6 km off the surface.</p>


            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>AOberon was discovered in Jan. 11, 1787 by William Herschel.</p>

            <h2>How Oberon Got its Name</h2>
            <p>Named by Herschel's son John in early 19th century for the king of the fairies in Shakespeare's "A
                Midsummer Night's Dream."</p>
